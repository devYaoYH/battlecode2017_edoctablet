In the meantime, feel free to look through our code (in order of development):
- endor
- dantooine
- kashyyyk
- mustafar
- hoth_stable
- Alderaan (Sprint Tourney entry)
- tatooine (Transit to OOP)
- YavinIV
- Dagobah (Seeding Tourney entry - Top 8!)
- Mandalore
- Kamino
- Scarif (Qualifying Tourney entry - Top 32 :/)
- Scarif_stable

I suggest you start at Scarif_stable as it's a clened-up version of Scarif with additional comments written post-competition (ain't no time for comments during! :P)
